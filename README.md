## Description 

I decided to build a website in order to showcase all the amazing projects that I have been developing. The technologies included in this website include HTML and CSS. The website includes the following pages:

* Index
* Portfolio
* Contact

The portfolio page includes links to finished projects. The contact page includes a form for those users that wish to contact me. 


## Installation

No intallation needed. Most browsers will support this project. 


## Credits

Thank you to Joe Rehfuss (https://github.com/Rufasa85) for his knowledge and patience.
